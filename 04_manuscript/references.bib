  abstract = {Watershed budget studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA, have demonstrated high calcium depletion of soil during the 20th century due, in part, to acid deposition. Over the past 25 years, tree growth (especially for sugar maple) has declined on the experimental watersheds at the HBEF. In October 1999, 0.85 Mg Ca/ha was added to Watershed 1 (W1) at the HBEF in the form of wollastonite (CaSiO3), a treatment that, by summer 2002, had raised the pH in the Oie horizon from 3.8 to 5.0 and, in the Oa horizon, from 3.9 to 4.2. We measured the response of sugar maple to the calcium fertilization treatment on W1. Foliar calcium concentration of canopy sugar maples in W1 increased markedly beginning the second year after treatment, and foliar manganese declined in years four and five. By 2005, the crown condition of sugar maple was much healthier in the treated watershed as compared with the untreated reference watershed (W6). Following high seed production in 2000 and 2002, the density of sugar maple seedlings increased significantly on W1 in comparison with W6 in 2001 and 2003. Survivorship of the 2003 cohort through July 2005 was much higher on W1 (36.6\%) than W6 (10.2\%). In 2003, sugar maple germinants on W1 were 50\% larger than those in reference plots, and foliar chlorophyll concentrations were significantly greater (0.27 g/m2 vs. 0.23 g/m2 leaf area). Foliage and fine-root calcium concentrations were roughly twice as high, and manganese concentrations twice as low in the treated than the reference seedlings in 2003 and 2004. Mycorrhizal colonization of seedlings was also much greater in the treated (22.4\% of root length) than the reference sites (4.4\%). A similar, though less dramatic, difference was observed for mycorrhizal colonization of mature sugar maples (56\% vs. 35\%). These results reinforce and extend other regional observations that sugar maple decline in the northeastern United States and southern Canada is caused in part by anthropogenic effects on soil calcium status, but the causal interactions among inorganic nutrition, physiological stress, mycorrhizal colonization, and seedling growth and health remain to be established.},

  abstract = {We examined the health and mycorrhizal colonization       rates of sugar maple germinants on a Calcium (Ca)- treated       watershed at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest and compared       their status to the health of seedlings growing on reference       sites. We quantified general sugar maple germinant health by       height, leaf area, biomass, and chlorophyll content. To       determine vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization       rates, we first cleared and stained germinant roots and then       examined their structures microscopically. We found that       sugar maple seedlings on the Ca-addition site were taller,       had larger leaves, more root, leaf, and stem biomass, and       more chlorophyll per unit leaf area. These seedlings also had       a significantly larger percentage of their roots colonized by       mycorrhizal fungi. Our results indicate a correlation between       soil Ca availability, mycorrhizal colonization rates, and       overall seedling health.       These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook       Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at       the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and       maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research       Station.},

  abstract = {Powdered and pelletized wollastonite (CaSiO3) was applied to an 11.8 ha forested watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in northern New Hampshire, U.S.A. during October of 1999. The dissolution of wollastonite was studied using watershed solute mass balances, and a 87Sr/86Sr isotopic tracer. The wollastonite (87Sr/86Sr = 0.70554) that was deposited directly into the stream channel began to dissolve immediately, resulting in marked increases in stream water Ca concentrations and decreases in the 87Sr/86Sr ratios from pre-application values of 0.872 mg/L and 0.72032 to values of {$\sim$}2.6 mg/L and 0.71818 respectively. After one calendar year, 401 kg of the initial 631 kg of wollastonite applied to the stream channel was exported as stream dissolved load, and 230 kg remained within the stream channel as residual CaSiO3 and/or adsorbed on streambed exchange sites. Using previously established values for streambed Ca exchange capacity at the HBEF, the dissolution rate for wollastonite was found to be consistent with dissolution rates measured in laboratory experiments. Initially, Ca was released from the mineral lattice faster than Si, resulting in the development of a Ca-depleted leached layer on mineral grains. The degree of preferential Ca release decreased with time and reached stoichiometric proportions after {$\sim$}6 months. Using Sr as a proxy for Ca, the Ca from wollastonite dissolution can be accurately tracked as it is transported through the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems of this watershed.},
